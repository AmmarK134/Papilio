Game Narrative Summary for Papilio
Papilio is a gripping single-player narrative game that explores the profound impact of choices across time. Set in a dystopian future in the year 2090 or beyond, players take on the role of a time traveler tasked with rewriting history to reshape the future. From ancient battles like the Trojan War to pivotal events such as The French Revolution and WWI, players face critical decisions: to fix these historical moments or let them play out as they did.

With each choice, the ripples form, creating new timelines and altering the course of humanity. The game masterfully combines historical authenticity with speculative fiction, offering players deep immersion and thought-provoking gameplay. By balancing the weight of moral dilemmas and the allure of what could have been, Papilio invites players to question the true meaning of responsibility and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.

The moment you seek awaits; will you preserve, or destroy? Yourself or time?
